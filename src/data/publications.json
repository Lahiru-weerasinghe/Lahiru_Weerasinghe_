      "text": "I developed a LoRa-based wireless communication system to address communication and safety challenges in Sri Lankaâ€™s fisheries industry. The system enables real-time data exchange between fishing vessels and shore stations, offering features such as emergency alerts, illegal fishing detection, sea weather prediction, and an early warning system. It integrates blockchain and smart contracts for secure, transparent communication. Leveraging low-power LoRa technology and IoT networks, this solution enhances coordination, improves safety, and boosts efficiency in the sector.",
